# 2025 Water Quality Monitoring Season Begins

We're pleased to announce that regular water quality monitoring has resumed for 2025 at both our key sampling locations along the River Tamar.

## Sampling Schedule

Our volunteer team will be collecting water samples twice weekly at:
- **Okel Tor**: Tuesdays and Fridays
- **Calstock**: Wednesdays and Saturdays

## What We're Testing

Each sample is analyzed for:
- **E. coli** - An indicator of fecal contamination
- **Intestinal Enterococci** - Another bacterial indicator particularly relevant for marine and estuarine waters

Results are typically available within 48 hours of sampling and will be published on this website.

## Recent Rainfall Impact

Keep in mind that recent heavy rainfall can significantly impact bacterial levels in the river. We always record rainfall data alongside our sampling to help contextualize the results.

Check back regularly for the latest results, and remember - when bacterial levels are elevated, it's best to avoid water contact activities like swimming or paddling.
