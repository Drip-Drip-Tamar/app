# About Drip Drip Tamar

Drip Drip Tamar is a community-led water quality monitoring project focused on the River Tamar, which forms the border between Cornwall and Devon.

## Our Mission

We provide regular, reliable water quality data to help local communities make informed decisions about water-based activities like swimming, paddling, and fishing.

## What We Monitor

We test water samples for bacterial indicators that suggest the presence of sewage or animal waste:

- **E. coli** - A bacterial indicator commonly found in human and animal intestines
- **Intestinal Enterococci** - Another bacterial indicator particularly useful for coastal and estuarine waters

## Testing Methods

Our testing follows established protocols used by environmental agencies:
- Samples collected using sterile techniques
- Laboratory analysis using membrane filtration methods
- Results reported as Colony Forming Units per 100ml (CFU/100ml)

## Understanding the Results

Generally:
- **Below 100 CFU/100ml** - Lower risk for water contact
- **100-1000 CFU/100ml** - Moderate risk - use caution
- **Above 1000 CFU/100ml** - Higher risk - avoid water contact

Remember that rainfall can dramatically increase bacterial levels, as surface runoff carries more contamination into the river.
